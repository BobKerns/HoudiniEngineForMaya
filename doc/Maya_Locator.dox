@page Maya_Locator Locator

The plug-in supports inputting Maya locators.

@section Maya_Locator_Input Input

Maya locators are inputted into a Houdini asset as points. For each locator that is being inputted, a point is created in the Houdini side. The translation, rotation, and scale of each locator are inputted as `P`, `orient`, and `scale` attribute of the respective point.
